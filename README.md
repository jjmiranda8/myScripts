# My Scripts

This directory will be used to store all of the daily scripts I create to help 
make my coding life a little easier. I'll continue to expand upon the scripts 
and to update this README.md with information about them.

I added the path of my .myScripts/ directory to $PATH by exporting it in the .bashrc
file so that I could call on these scripts from anywhere on my machine. 

## Website Template 

* This script creates a directory that you name and creates a template with linked
html, css, and js files to start testing out my ideas quickly.

## Automate git push

* This script will automate the git process so I can spend more time coding!
* Added add files to staging via confirmation with status updates
* Will also add creating repositories, would be nice to connect to github with this feature
