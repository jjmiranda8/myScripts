# My Scripts

This directory will be used to store all of the daily scripts I create to help 
make my coding life a little easier. I'll continue to expand upon the scripts 
and to update this README.md with information about them.

I added the path of my .myScripts/ directory to $PATH by exporting it in the .bashrc
file so that I could call on these scripts from anywhere on my machine. 

## Website Template 

* This script creates a directory a template with linked
  html, css, and js files to start testing out my ideas quickly.
* I've recently learned React and will be rethinking this tool. 

## Automate Version Control 

* This script will automate the git process so I can spend more time coding!
* This has been rewritten in python. Bash only supports strings and testing it isn't easy either.  
* can push with one prompt for small init message. 
* will be adding current date stamp feature

## Practice Data Structures

* This is the beginning of a larger web app that I'm planning
* Creates repo with source and test files for another ds/algo question
